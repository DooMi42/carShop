# 🚗 CarShop

Welcome to CarShop - where cars are sold, not your dignity!

## About The Project

- 💰 Compare prices and features side by side
- 🛒 Virtual shopping cart (no, you can't download a car... yet)
- 👤 User profiles and saved favorites
- 💳 Mock checkout process

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript
- RESTful API integration
- Local Storage for persistent data
